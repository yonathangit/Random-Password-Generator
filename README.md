# Random-Password-Generator

Hello and Welcome to my password generator app I built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

Features:
1. Amount of Characters - It has an input field for you to insert amount of characters to be put in the random password generated. 
2. Two Password Displays - The app generates two passwords at a given time.
3. Responsiveness - You can use this app on smart phones as well as large-width devices.
4. Clear Input - Clears the input field.
5. Clear Everything - Clears everything (Display Messages, Error Messages, Input fields and so on).

- If not given any character amount, the system automatically generates passwords of 16 characters and shows a success message. 
- If it is given an invalid amount (anything other than numbers), the system displays an error message.
